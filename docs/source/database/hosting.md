# Hosting

AgriOS provides reliable and secure hosting for all initial users through our partner, Cloudpepper. This ensures that user data is protected, systems are highly available, and performance is optimized for agricultural operations.

## Current Hosting Provider

All initial AgriOS users are hosted on Cloudpepper, a trusted cloud service provider specializing in scalable and secure infrastructure. Cloudpepper offers:

- High availability and uptime
