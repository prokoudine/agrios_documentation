# AgriOS Versioning

AgriOS is initially launched on version 18, providing users with the latest features and improvements available in the platform. This ensures optimal performance, security, and compatibility with current technologies.

## Future Version Support

As the needs of our users evolve, we may offer support for additional versions, including:

- Version 17
- Version 16
- Version 19

This approach allows organizations to choose the version that best fits their requirements and infrastructure. Updates regarding supported versions will be provided as AgriOS develops.
