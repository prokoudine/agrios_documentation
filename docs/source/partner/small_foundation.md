# Small Foundation
**Small Foundation** is a philanthropic foundation based in Ireland with a vision of a thriving Africa free from extreme poverty and a mission to catalyse income-generating opportunities, particularly for those in rural areas. Using a combination of grants, debt, and equity, Small Foundation supports initiatives that improve business ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa by expanding the access of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises to knowledge, skilled human resources, finance, technology, and markets.

* “Advance Insight’s work with AgriOS seeks to strengthen the digital infrastructure that many agri-SMEs lack. By making the platform open-source and accessible, they are reducing barriers to digital adoption and improving the quality and reliability of operational data across the sector. This has the potential to support more efficient decision-making for lenders and other ecosystem actors, and contributes to broader efforts to expand access to finance for agricultural enterprises.”*
