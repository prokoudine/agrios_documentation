# Odoo Enterprise

One of the advantages of Odoo’s architecture is that a database created with the Community edition can be easily migrated to the Enterprise edition at any point. This flexibility allows organizations to start with the open-source Community version and upgrade to Enterprise as their needs evolve, without losing data or functionality.

## Migrating from Community to Enterprise

The migration process is straightforward: Enterprise modules are installed on top of the existing Community database, instantly unlocking additional features and official support. All core data, customizations, and configurations are preserved, making the transition seamless for users and administrators.

## Odoo Enterprise Features

Odoo Enterprise builds on the Community edition by offering a range of proprietary modules and advanced capabilities. Key differences include:

- **Additional Modules:** Enterprise provides extra modules for accounting, document management, marketing automation, and more.
- **Mobile Apps:** Enhanced mobile applications for iOS and Android.
- **Official Support:** Access to Odoo’s professional support and services.
- **Advanced Usability:** Improved user interface, dashboards, and productivity tools.
- **Integration:** Better integration with third-party services and hardware.

Choosing Enterprise is ideal for organizations that require advanced features, scalability, and dedicated support, while still benefiting from the flexibility and extensibility of the Odoo platform.
