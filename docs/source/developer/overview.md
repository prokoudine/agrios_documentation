# AgriOS Developer Documentation

## Introduction

**AgriOS** is an advanced agricultural management platform designed to streamline operations for farmers, agribusinesses, and supply chain stakeholders. Built on open source technologies, its goals are extensibility, reliability, and ease of integration with other systems. This documentation is meant for developers, contributors, and maintainers, providing an overview of the system, guiding principles, and the workflow for collaborating on AgriOS.

---

## Odoo Community Architecture

AgriOS leverages the **Odoo Community** ecosystem, benefitting from its modular architecture and extensibility. The system comprises back-end data management, business logic modules, and a user-friendly front-end interface.

**High-level architecture diagram:**

```
[Data Sources] <---> [Odoo Backend] <---> [REST API/GraphQL] <---> [React Frontend]
      |                    |                    |                     |
[External Sensors]     [PostgreSQL]        [Business Logic]      [User Experience]
```

**Main Components:**
- **Odoo Backend:** Handles core domain models, workflows, and business logic.
- **API Layer:** Exposes system features as RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for integration.
- **Frontend (React):** Interactive user interface, visualization, dashboards.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):** Manages persistence and transactions.

---

## OCA Component Interaction

The OCA (Odoo Community Association) patterns within AgriOS typically follow component chaining:

```
Component A <--> Component B <--> Component C
```

- **Component A:** Data ingest and preprocessing
- **Component B:** Core processing, business logic, and calculations
- **Component C:** Presentation layer, reporting, and integrations

---

## Design Principles

AgriOS development adheres to the following design principles:

- **Modularity:** Each module/component is self-contained with a clear responsibility.
- **Scalability:** Designed to easily accommodate additional users and increased data loads.
- **Maintainability:** Clean, well-documented code, facilitating updates and extensions.
- **Security:** Follows security best practices to protect sensitive data and system integrity.
- **Performance:** Optimized algorithms and efficient database queries deliver a responsive experience.

---

## Technology Stack

AgriOS uses a modern development stack including:

- **Programming Languages:**  
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Primary back-end and Odoo modules)  
  - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) (React front-end)
- **Frameworks:**  
  - [Odoo Community](https://www.odoo.com/page/community) (ERP backend)  
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (API and web services)  
  - [React](https://react.dev/) (front-end UI)
- **Database:**  
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Tools:**  
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (containerization)  
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (version control)  
  - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (CI/CD)

Refer to [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) for exact component versions.

---

## Development Workflow

Recommended process for contributing to AgriOS:

1. **Fork** the repository and create a new feature branch.
2. **Develop** your changes, committing logically with clear messages.
3. **Push** the branch to your remote fork.
4. **Open a pull request** against the main repo.
5. **Request review**, address feedback from maintainers.
6. **Merge** after approval; ensure all tests are green and CI/CD passes.

---

## Code Structure

AgriOS follows a clear directory layout:

- `/src`: Application source code (Odoo modules, Django apps, React components)
- `/tests`: Comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests
- `/docs`: Project and API documentation
- `/config`: Configuration files (environment, deployment, Docker)
- `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `.github/`: Dependency and CI/CD settings

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Testing strategy includes:

- **Unit Tests:** Validate individual functions and classes.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure modules work seamlessly together.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate real-world use cases and workflows.

**Tools:**  
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for Python testing  
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript/React  
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) automates test runs.

**Running tests locally:**
```bash
pytest
```

---

## Deployment

AgriOS uses automated deployment mechanisms:

- **Environments:** `dev`, `staging`, `production`
- **Automation:** Containerized with Docker; CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Rollback:** Previous stable images/artifacts can be restored using Docker scripts or CI/CD workflow.

See [`/.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows/) for automation scripts.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Style:** Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python; [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for JS/React.
- **Commits:** Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for message formatting.
- **Pull Requests:** Required for all contributions—include a detailed summary and reference related issues.

Example commit message:
```
feat(api): add weather data import endpoint
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

- **Dependency conflict**  
  *Solution:* Update `requirements.txt` and rebuild the environment.
- **Test failures**  
  *Solution:* Run tests locally with `pytest` and check log output.
- **Database errors**  
  *Solution:* Verify connection settings in `/config/` and database service status.
